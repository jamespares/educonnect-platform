## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test files in the `tests/` directory
2. Follow existing patterns and naming conventions
3. Use descriptive test names and organize with `describe` blocks
4. Include both positive and negative test cases

### Updating Tests
- Update tests when adding new features
- Modify selectors if UI elements change
- Add new test cases for edge cases
- Keep tests independent and repeatable

## Best Practices

1. **Run tests before deploying**
2. **Check all test categories** - don't just run navigation tests
3. **Review failed tests carefully** - they often reveal real issues
4. **Test on multiple devices** - the test suite covers this automatically
5. **Keep test data realistic** - use actual email formats and valid data
