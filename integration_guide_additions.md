Living Comfortably in China as a Foreigner
Embrace the Digital Lifestyle (Apps & Cashless Society)
Set up WeChat & Alipay: These two apps are essential. WeChat is used for everything from messaging to payments, and Alipay is the other dominant payment app. Plan to open a Chinese bank account and bind it to WeChat/Alipay as soon as possible

. (You can use some features with a foreign card initially, more on that below.)
Cashless payments: China is a largely cashless society – mobile payment via phone is accepted everywhere, even by street vendors. Carrying lots of cash isn’t necessary, and many places won’t even accept foreign credit cards. Set up WeChat Pay or Alipay and get used to scanning QR codes for payments

.
Download key apps: Beyond WeChat and Alipay, there’s a whole ecosystem of apps for daily life. For shopping, use Taobao or JD.com (you can find anything online)
reddit.com
. For food delivery, Meituan and Ele.me will bring meals and groceries to your door
reddit.com
. Need a ride? DiDi is the Chinese Uber (you can also access DiDi via an English mini-app inside Alipay)
reddit.com
. Navigation is easier with Chinese map apps like Gaode (Amap) or Baidu Maps (more accurate locally than Google). Download Pleco, a Chinese dictionary app, to help with signs and translation on the go
reddit.com
. Some people also get QQ (an older messaging app) since a few services or contacts might use it
reddit.com
. To understand trends or find travel/food tips, check out Douyin (China’s TikTok) and Xiaohongshu (Reddit/Instagram hybrid)
reddit.com
.
VPN and internet access: Many Western sites (Google, Facebook/Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) are blocked. Get a reliable VPN before arriving in China
reddit.com
 – install it on your phone and laptop. Not all VPNs work well in China’s environment, so do some research on which are currently effective. With a VPN, you can access blocked sites (even if, say, you want to… stream certain content). And yes, as some expats joke, if you’re looking for adult content, mainstream sites are blocked – but tech-savvy folks note that using a VPN or torrenting is an open secret
reddit.com
.
SIM cards and connectivity: Consider getting an eSIM or international roaming plan for your first couple of days so you’re connected upon landing
reddit.com
. Once in China, get a local SIM card (major providers are China Mobile, China Unicom, China Telecom) – you’ll need your passport for this. A local number is needed for many registrations (e.g. apps, bank account).
Leverage app features: WeChat has a built-in translator – you can scan images or text and translate on the fly
reddit.com
, which is super helpful for menus or signs. It also has thousands of mini-programs (for bike rentals, bill payment, etc.). Alipay and WeChat offer useful services like utility bill payments, train ticket booking, and even hospital appointment registrations once you’re more settled.
Mobile payment via QR codes is ubiquitous in China – from street vendors to musicians, almost everyone accepts WeChat Pay or Alipay. Paying with a smartphone has essentially replaced cash for day-to-day transactions
businessinsider.com
. As a newcomer, it’s worth adapting quickly to this cashless society, since even hailing a taxi or getting food delivery is easiest through in-app payments.
Language: Learn Mandarin & Avoid the Bubble
Learn some Mandarin: Making an effort with the language will hugely enrich your experience and integration
reddit.com
. Many expats (especially English teachers) arrive with zero Chinese, but taking classes or using online resources will pay off. If your employer offers free Chinese lessons, take them (some expats paid ¥100/hour out of pocket for lessons – grab the free chance!)
reddit.com
. You might also consider hiring a tutor or finding a language exchange partner. Immersion helps – some joke that getting a Chinese girlfriend/boyfriend is the fastest way to learn, and indeed having a local significant other or close friends forces you to practice daily
reddit.com
.
Don’t stay in an expat bubble: It’s easy, especially in big cities, to only hang out with other foreigners – but you’ll miss out on authentic experiences. Make local friends, or at least friends outside your own nationality
reddit.com
. Those who isolate in expat circles often never progress in language or understanding of the culture. Step outside your comfort zone – join activities with locals, and say yes when colleagues invite you to dinners or events.
Focus on fundamentals (tones, etc.): Chinese is a tough language, especially due to tones. It requires more deliberate study than, say, picking up Spanish or French. If you can, dedicate regular time to study – even 1-2 hours a day of focused practice can have you conversing within 6 months to a year
reddit.com
. Don’t expect to “pick it up” just by living there; you have to put in effort
reddit.com
. A good teacher will drill you on pronunciation and tones early
reddit.com
 – it can be tedious, but it’s crucial. Make use of apps (Duolingo, HelloChinese) for basics, and Pleco’s flashcards for building vocabulary
reddit.com
.
Practice every day: Use Chinese in real situations. Greet your doorman or neighbors, chat with the taxi (DiDi) driver if you can, or try ordering food in Chinese. Even if you only know a few words, use them – locals appreciate the effort, and it helps you improve
reddit.com
. Watching Chinese TV shows or using Chinese subtitles can help with listening. And don’t be afraid of mistakes – people will usually be patient and encouraging.
Survival without Chinese: In major cities, you can get by with very limited Chinese – translation apps and gestures will do in a pinch, and younger people often know a bit of English. But your life will be much smoother and less isolated if you learn key phrases. At minimum, learn how to say addresses (for taxis), numbers, greetings, and how to ask for things. Even a little Mandarin can prevent miscommunications and endear you to locals

Food and Dining Tips
Be open-minded with food: China is a food lover’s paradise, with regional cuisines that are vastly different. Embrace the opportunity to try new dishes! Don’t be the person who only eats McDonald’s or complains that “nothing tastes like home” – constant negativity about local food will alienate you from locals and other expats
reddit.com
. Approach food with curiosity: you might discover new favorites.
High variety, wide price range: You can eat extremely well on a budget in China. Local noodle shops, rice bowls, or street food might cost only ¥20-¥40 per meal
mighil.com
 – often delicious and filling. On the other hand, high-end restaurants (or imported Western food) can cost 10x more on the same street
reddit.com
. Explore the full range: have $5 noodle soup one day and splurge on a fancy restaurant occasionally. This is a great way to save money while still enjoying yourself.
Use Dianping for restaurant hunting: Dianping (大众点评) is the Chinese Yelp – an app/website for restaurant reviews and rankings. It’s all in Chinese, but even if you can’t read, you can see ratings and photos of dishes. It’s invaluable for finding the best local eateries or popular dishes in your city
reddit.com
. When traveling domestically, Dianping can guide you to each city’s specialties.
Ordering and paying at restaurants: Many restaurants now use QR code systems for ordering. Typically, you scan a QR code at the table which opens a mini-app menu (in Chinese). Don’t be intimidated – often there are pictures of the dishes, and you can always ask a waiter for help. You then pay through the app (WeChat/Alipay) or at the counter when you leave. It’s very convenient once you get the hang of it
reddit.com
. If the menu has no English or pictures, using your phone’s translate camera (or Google Lens via VPN) can help.
Expect crowds at meal times: In popular restaurants, especially in big cities, it’s common to take a number and wait for a table. Chinese people don’t mind lining up for good food. You might wait 15 minutes or over an hour for famous hot pot or brunch spots during peak times
reddit.com
. Go early or be patient – it’s part of the experience. Often there’s a seating area with tea or snacks while you wait.
Delivery and convenience: China takes food delivery to the next level. Apps like Meituan Waimai or Ele.me will deliver meals from almost any restaurant, usually in 30 minutes or less. You can also get groceries, medicine, and even Starbucks delivered to your door. Delivery fees are low (sometimes ~¥5 or even free), so it’s easy to get lazy – but it’s a lifesaver on a rainy day or when you’re working late
reddit.com
. Tip: delivery drivers might call you to find your address; learn how to say your building/unit in Chinese or have someone help set a clear address in the app.
Dietary restrictions: If you have special dietary needs (vegetarian, halal, allergies), learn how to express this in Chinese. For example, vegetarians should know phrases like “我吃素” (wo chi su – “I eat vegetarian”) and “不要肉” (bu yao rou – “no meat”). In Muslim-majority areas or Muslim-owned restaurants, you’ll see the word 清真 (qīngzhēn) which means halal
reddit.com
. Big cities have a growing number of vegan/vegetarian eateries too, but local dishes might use meat broths or lard unknowingly, so communicate clearly.
Carry tissues & sanitizer: A quirky but important tip – always have tissues or a packet of toilet paper on you, and maybe hand sanitizer. Many public restrooms (and even some restaurant restrooms) do not provide toilet paper or soap
reddit.com
. It’s normal for locals to carry tissue packs. Also, you may encounter squat toilets, which can be an experience if you’ve never used one. Don’t stress – practice your squats (half joking), and remember you usually shouldn’t flush paper in those (bins are provided). In modern buildings you’ll often find Western-style toilets, but it’s good to be prepared for anything.
Housing and Accommodation
Know the rental process: Unlike month-to-month renting common elsewhere, in China it’s standard to pay rent quarterly. A typical requirement is 3 months rent upfront + 1 month’s rent as deposit, and if you used an agent, a commission (often 50% of one month’s rent) split between you and the landlord or sometimes paid fully by the tenant
reddit.com
. This means your move-in cost could be 4.5 months of rent or more, so budget for that. Some landlords might negotiate (e.g. you can sometimes pay monthly, but usually at a higher rate). Always get a receipt for payments.
Finding apartments: If your school or company provides housing or a temporary hotel on arrival, take advantage of that help
reddit.com
. If you need to find a place yourself, be prepared that most listings are in Chinese. Apps like 58 Tongcheng (58.com) and Anjuke have tons of listings but are tough to navigate without language skills. Ziroom is an app/website popular in big cities that lists verified apartments (often furnished and clean) and allows monthly rent payments – it’s slightly pricier but foreigner-friendly. Most expats end up using real estate agents, though – you find an English-speaking agent or bring a Chinese friend, tell them your requirements, and they’ll show you places. The agent fee is usually one-half month rent (sometimes paid by the landlord, sometimes by you).
Documents for renting: To sign a lease, you will need a local phone number and often a Chinese bank account (for deposit transfers or rent auto-debit)
reddit.com
. You’ll also need your passport, visa, and sometimes proof of employment. If you’re on a work visa, ensure the lease is properly registered (you’ll use the signed lease to register with the police as well). If your Chinese isn’t strong, get the contract in both English and Chinese or have someone explain the clauses, especially regarding deposit refund and any fees.
Apartment tips: Apartments in China can range from brand-new high-rises to older walk-up buildings. Figure out what matters to you – new buildings have modern amenities but higher rent; older ones are cheaper but might have squat toilets or no elevators. Check things like water pressure, AC/heat, and internet setup when you view a place. It’s common for landlords to provide basic furniture and appliances (bed, sofa, washing machine, fridge, etc.), especially in furnished apartments aimed at young renters. If you need anything else – from a microwave to decor – Taobao truly has everything and delivers fast
reddit.com
.
Neighborhood and commute: In megacities like Shanghai or Beijing, living close to work can greatly improve your quality of life. Many expats recommend paying a bit more to live in a central location or near the office, rather than enduring a 1.5-hour subway commute from a cheaper suburb
reddit.com
reddit.com
. In cities like Shanghai, popular expat areas (e.g. Jing’an, French Concession) are fun but pricey. You can find more affordable housing further out, but consider the social trade-off – if you live far, you might miss out on evening meetups or spend a lot on Didi rides. It’s a balance between saving money and having convenience.
Utilities and others: Rent often doesn’t include utilities. Budget for electricity, water, gas, and internet. These aren’t usually expensive (maybe a few hundred RMB total per month depending on usage), but you often have to manually pay them via apps or at convenience stores. Your agent or landlord should show you how – many use Alipay/WeChat mini-programs to pay utilities. Also, note that heating in the south of China is not centralized – cities south of the Yangtze (like Shanghai, Chengdu, etc.) may get chilly indoors in winter because there’s no central heating, so you’ll rely on AC heating units.
Furnishings and size differences: Chinese apartments might have hard mattresses (it’s a common preference). If that’s an issue, you can buy a softer topper. If you’re tall or have a large shoe size or clothing size, shopping might be challenging in local stores
reddit.com
. For example, shoes above about US size 11/12 (45 EUR) are hard to find in stock. Bring a few essentials (extra pairs of big shoes, or order online). International brands exist in big malls, but they’re often pricier than back home. For clothing, custom tailoring is also an option and not too expensive in some cities – a tailor can copy your favorite shirt or suit.
Visa, Registration and Legal Matters
Work visa & permits: Make sure you come on the correct visa for working (typically a Z visa). After you arrive, that visa will be converted into a Residence Permit within 30 days – your employer should handle the paperwork for this. Never work on a tourist or business visa; it’s illegal and can get you detained or deported if caught. Unfortunately some sketchy schools still try to hire teachers without proper visas – don’t risk it. Insist on a legal work permit.
Police registration: This is a crucial step that newcomers often overlook. Within 24 hours of arriving at your new address in China, you must register at the local Public Security Bureau (police station)
china-briefing.com
. If you’re staying in a hotel, the hotel does this for you automatically (still, confirm at check-in). But if you move into an apartment, you (or your landlord) need to go to the police station with your passport and lease to register. This also applies whenever you move to a new apartment or city, or re-enter China from abroad – basically any time you have a new address, even for short stays, re-register within 24 hours (72 hours in rural areas)
china-briefing.com
. The registration process is usually quick and you’ll get a form (keep it safe with your passport). It’s needed for things like getting a new visa or renewing your residence permit
china-briefing.com
.
Know the rules: China has clear laws for foreigners. Ignorance is not a valid excuse. Avoid trouble by following the basics: don’t overstay your visa, don’t take up freelance side gigs that aren’t allowed under your work permit, and definitely avoid anything illegal. Drug laws in particular are extremely strict – people do get randomly tested in bars, and foreigners have been jailed or deported for small quantities. It’s just not worth it.
Sensitive topics: As an expat, it’s wise to steer clear of political or sensitive discussions in public or with people you don’t know well. The “Three T’s” (Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen) and topics like Xinjiang or Hong Kong protests can be considered sensitive
reddit.com
. It’s not that you can never discuss them, but be aware of your environment and audience. In classrooms, avoid these topics unless they’re part of the curriculum and handled diplomatically. Generally, focus on positive cultural exchange rather than political debates, especially online or in messages (remember, Chinese social media is monitored).
Contracts and rights: As a foreign employee, you do have rights. Ensure you get a written employment contract (in Chinese and English if possible) – this should outline your salary, work hours, overtime pay (if any), vacation, airfare allowance (common in teaching contracts), and conditions for termination. Don’t hesitate to ask questions before signing. Chinese labor law applies to you too, but enforcement can be a gray area. If your employer asks you to do something sketchy (like work on the wrong visa or not abide by contract terms), you can push back by pointing to the contract or laws. That said, many expats find it more effective to resolve issues amicably than through legal fights. PSB (Public Security Bureau) and authorities: maintain a good relationship with authorities – register on time, be polite if you have to extend visas or deal with police. They are generally helpful if you follow rules. Breaking rules, however, can get you blacklisted.
Health insurance & hospitals: Most foreign teachers get basic local health insurance via their employer. Ask your HR about what coverage you have and how to use it. In big cities, there are international clinics with English-speaking doctors, but they are expensive if your insurance doesn’t cover them. Local hospitals are much cheaper but can be bewildering – usually, you register, pay a small fee, and line up to see a doctor, then pay for any tests or meds separately. Bring a colleague or friend to help the first time if you can. Also, bring a supply of any essential medications you take, and possibly an extra pair of glasses, etc. Common Western OTC medicines may not be readily available or might have different brand names. It’s a good idea to bring things like ibuprofen, cold/flu meds, allergy meds from home in case you need them
reddit.com
. (Pharmacies in China are plentiful, but the language barrier can be tough when you just want a decongestant.)
Emergency numbers and support: Note that China’s emergency number for police is 110, for ambulance 120, fire 119. Keep your employer’s contact handy for any urgent situation. Also, your embassy can be a resource – register with them if they have a program for expats in the country. It’s rare to need it, but good to know.
Banking and Money Matters
Setting up a bank account: Opening a local bank account will make your life much easier. Many employers will insist on it for salary payment. Typically, they’ll recommend a bank and even accompany you to help open the account
reddit.com
. Common banks for foreigners include Bank of China, ICBC, China Merchants Bank, etc., but honestly go with the bank your company suggests – it’s often about convenience and their payroll system
reddit.com
. To open the account, bring your passport, a copy of your visa/residence permit, and sometimes your work permit and employment contract just in case
reddit.com
. The process involves filling forms (your name will be the “pinyin” version), and you’ll get a UnionPay bank card on the spot. Memorize your 6-digit PIN – you’ll need it for ATM withdrawals and sometimes for large purchases.
Linking to mobile pay: Once you have your Chinese bank card, immediately bind it to WeChat Pay and Alipay
reddit.com
. This will unlock the full functionality of these apps (like easier money transfers and higher payment limits). You can then top up your phone, pay utility bills, or even split restaurant bills all through your phone. Most expats hardly ever visit ATMs or carry cash after this – nearly everything is paid via scan.
Cashless living: China’s mobile payment adoption is years ahead of many countries. Paying with your phone is the norm
businessinsider.com
. In fact, there are establishments (and vending machines, bike rentals, etc.) that only accept mobile payments. For the first week or so before your bank account is ready, you can use Alipay’s “Tour Pass” feature or WeChat’s international card feature to load money from a foreign card
reddit.com
. This creates a temporary e-wallet you can scan with – very useful to get through initial days. Keep a few hundred RMB in cash as backup, but you’ll be surprised how little you use it. Even taxis and convenience stores prefer scanning your QR code.
Sending money home: If you plan to save and remit money to your home country, look into services like Panda Remit
reddit.com
 or Wise (if accessible via VPN). Many expats use Panda Remit now – it has low fees and directly deposits to foreign accounts. Banks can do international wire transfers, but they often require paperwork (like proof of income tax paid) and have worse exchange rates. There are also currency conversion limits (USD $50k per year for Chinese nationals; for foreigners, typically you can convert and send out your after-tax income with the right documents). It’s good to keep an eye on exchange rates and plan transfers in chunks.
Living on a budget: One big advantage of living in China is that local cost of living can be quite low relative to salaries (depending on the city and your lifestyle). To save money, do as locals do: eat at local eateries, use public transportation (bus/subway fares are often just ¥2-¥5 per ride and very affordable
mighil.com
), and shop on domestic e-commerce for deals. For instance, furnishing your apartment or buying electronics on Taobao/JD will usually be cheaper than importing or buying foreign brands. Street markets and “Taobao villages” (local wholesale markets) can get you bargain furniture, clothes, etc., if you don’t mind haggling.
Bring some cash (and keep it pristine): If you’re bringing foreign currency cash to exchange, make sure the bills are clean and undamaged
reddit.com
. Chinese banks can be surprisingly picky – they might reject a note for a small pen mark or a tear. The easiest place to change money is usually Bank of China, and you’ll need your passport. There are also ATMs in big cities that take foreign cards to withdraw RMB, but your home bank might charge fees.
Unique hacks and items: A few money-related tips from veteran expats: If you expect to need larger-sized condoms or personal items, bring an ample supply from home – Chinese brands tend to run smaller, and while Western brands are sold, the “large” sizes may be harder to find in stores
reddit.com
 (you can get them on JD or in specialty shops later, but have some initially). Likewise, if you’re particular about things like deodorant (stick vs. spray) or toothpaste brands, bring enough for a while; local supermarkets have a limited selection of foreign brands, though one can find almost everything on Taobao with patience
reddit.com
. For women, if you prefer tampons, note they are less common in China (pads are the norm), so consider bringing a supply. These comfort items can save you money (and the hassle of hunting them down) early on.
Bargaining: In markets and smaller shops, bargaining is expected. Don’t be afraid to negotiate prices at places like electronics markets, clothing stalls, or when buying souvenirs. A friendly but firm approach works – often you can get 20-30% off the initial price (which is usually an inflated “foreigner price”). This can save you money, but also it’s a cultural experience. Big malls and stores have fixed prices, so use context to know when haggling is appropriate.
Building credit: China doesn’t really have an accessible credit card system for foreigners initially (unless you have a long-term residence and strong banking history). But the good news is, you won’t need a credit card – debit cards + mobile pay suffice. Apps like Alipay have a credit feature (Huabei) and WeChat has WeiLiDai, but those require a track record and some integration with the Chinese credit system, so not relevant until you’ve been around longer. In short, plan to operate on a debit/cash basis. The upside: it encourages you to live within your means and maybe save more.
Building a Social Life and Network
WeChat is king for socializing: WeChat isn’t just for chatting with Chinese friends – it’s also how expats connect. There are countless WeChat groups for expat communities, hobbies, and events in each city. After you arrive, ask other expats or colleagues to invite you to some groups. For example, you might find groups for “Shanghai Ultimate Frisbee” or “Chengdu Expat Entrepreneurs” or just general city-specific expat chats. These groups are gold mines for getting tips (where to buy XYZ, which restaurants are good, second-hand items for sale, etc.) and making friends. Don’t be shy about joining – people often post “hey, I’m new here” introductions. If you’re not sure where to start, use sites like Meetup.com to find gatherings
reddit.com
, or check if your city has an Internations chapter or Facebook group. Once you attend an event or two, you’ll get plugged into the WeChat networks quickly. Also, follow local English-language WeChat official accounts or websites (e.g. “Let’s Shanghai”, “Shanghai WOW”, “Chengdu-Expat”) for event listings – they often post QR codes to join specific groups
reddit.com
.
Make friends outside work: If you’re coming as a teacher, your coworkers might be your first friend circle, which is great. But try to meet others too – locals and expats outside your school. Say yes to social invitations; go to that open-mic night or hiking trip. China has a huge variety of people, including a lot of interesting expats in fields from tech to art to hospitality. In big cities, you can find a community for any interest. For instance, in Shanghai you can find groups of people playing board games, doing photography walks, coding meetups, salsa dancing, you name it
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Whatever your hobby is, chances are there’s a scene for it. This will help you not only enjoy your time more, but also avoid feeling isolated.
Cultural etiquette in friendships: Building local friendships might take a little patience. Many Chinese folks are friendly and curious to meet foreigners, especially if you share interests. A few things to keep in mind: the concept of “face” (面子) – essentially respect and not causing embarrassment – is important. Always try to give compliments and avoid criticizing someone openly; if your friend pays for dinner, thank them and maybe insist once or twice to pay (it’s common to fight mildly over the bill out of politeness). You’ll notice people may be more indirect in expressing “no” – learn to read context. Also, hierarchy can matter: for example, showing extra respect to elders or your boss is expected (e.g. let your boss toast first at a banquet). Be aware that some humor or sarcasm might not translate well; what’s jokey in your culture could be taken literally in China. Overall, being modest and good-natured goes a long way. Avoid touchy subjects (politics, etc.) unless you know someone well
reddit.com
. Once you form a good bond, Chinese friends are extremely hospitable and will go out of their way to help you feel at home.
Learn from locals: Say yes to local experiences. Colleagues might invite you to a hotpot dinner, or to celebrate Chinese New Year with their family, or simply to play basketball or sing karaoke (KTV) – do it! These moments will immerse you in the culture. Try joining local clubs or classes – for example, a calligraphy class, a martial arts gym, or a mahjong group. Not only do you learn something new, but you also meet people across the culture divide. And if you’re in China, you have a great chance to explore traditions: learn to cook a Chinese dish from a friend, or ask about the festivals. This creates shared understanding and stories to tell.
Expat support system: Sometimes you just want to speak English and share your frustrations or jokes about the quirks of life abroad – that’s where having expat friends helps. The expat communities in cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, etc., are quite active. You’ll find that people are welcoming; we’ve all been “new” before. Whether it’s grabbing a beer at the Irish pub that expats go to, or attending a church or volunteer group, connect with people who understand your background. They can offer advice on a difficult employer, tips on where to buy ingredients for a Western recipe, or lend you a book in English. Just be mindful not to fall into only socializing with expats. A healthy balance is key to a fulfilling life abroad.
Family and relationships: If you’re coming with a family, seek out the local international schools or community centers – they often have parent networks. If you have kids, there are mom/dad WeChat groups, playdates, and so on, especially in cities with big expat families (Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou have many). For single folks, dating in China can be an adventure of its own – there are Tinder-like apps (Tantan, Momo) but usage varies. Some expats date locals, some date fellow expats; just be aware of cultural differences in dating norms. (And if it gets serious, understand the legal hoops for marriage, etc.) No matter your situation, having a support network will ease homesickness.
Understand local social norms: For example, you’ll notice Chinese friends might show care by fussing over you (“Wear more clothes, it’s cold!” or “Have you eaten?”). It’s a cultural way to show concern, so take it as a sign of friendliness. Drinking culture is also a thing – at dinners, people will toast with baijiu (strong liquor) or beer. It’s polite to join to an extent, but if you can’t drink, just say so (or use the trick of toasting with a full cup but only sipping). KTV (karaoke) is a favorite social activity – don’t worry if you can’t sing; enthusiasm is more appreciated than skill. Embrace these experiences, even if they feel out of your comfort zone. They often become the best memories. And yes, don’t be surprised if locals insist that drinking hot water is a cure-all – you’ll see everyone with a thermos of warm water or tea, and you might even start doing it yourself!
City-Specific Pointers
Shanghai (上海): A massive, modern city with a very international feel. Pros: Huge expat community, lots of international restaurants and events, more people who speak English, and first-class infrastructure (clean, efficient metro). It’s China’s most cosmopolitan city, so you can find everything from authentic French bakeries to Mexican taco joints. Socially, it means you can always find familiar comforts, and there are endless networking opportunities. Cons: It’s expensive by Chinese standards. Rent in central areas like Jing’an, Xuhui, the Former French Concession, or Lujiazui (Pudong) is steep – on par with big Western cities. Many expats choose those areas for convenience and nightlife, but some move a bit farther out for cheaper rent. Keep in mind Shanghai is geographically large – living in distant suburbs (like Minhang or Jiading) can significantly impact your social life unless you’re okay with long metro rides
reddit.com
. Shanghai’s expat scene is so large that you can end up in a comfy bubble; push yourself to use Mandarin and interact with locals or you might leave after a year having never really “experienced” China beyond a Westernized bubble. Traffic can be intense, but the metro and didi are great alternatives. Air quality is moderate (not as good as smaller cities, but better than Beijing). Overall, Shanghai is a great landing pad for foreigners – very accessible and lots of opportunities. Just budget accordingly and take advantage of the myriad activities (from trivia nights to art galleries to sports leagues). Follow the WeChat accounts for Shanghai events to stay in the loop
reddit.com
. Chengdu (成都): The capital of Sichuan province, known for a relaxed lifestyle, pandas, and spicy hotpot. Chengdu is often called one of China’s most livable cities. Pros: Lower cost of living – rent and food are much cheaper than Beijing/Shanghai. The city has a famous tea house culture; people spend afternoons playing mahjong and drinking tea. It’s very easy to make local friends if you try – Chengdu folks are laid-back and friendly. The food is incredible (if you like spicy) – hotpot is a must-try, and there are lots of street snacks and flavorful dishes. Cons: Fewer people speak English here compared to the big coastal cities, so daily life will push you to use Chinese (not a bad thing, but can be challenging at first). Important note: police officers or doctors in Chengdu generally won’t speak English, so a translation app or a Chinese friend’s help is vital in those situations
reddit.com
. Climate-wise, Chengdu is humid and often cloudy – it’s known for drizzly grey weather (bring an umbrella). On the flip side, summer is not as scorching as some other cities, except when the infamous “five furnace” heat waves hit. Chengdu has a decent expat scene – a number of expat bars, some Western restaurants, and events. It’s growing as more foreigners discover it. The nightlife can be surprisingly vibrant (lots of clubs, live music, etc.). Also, Chengdu is somewhat famous for a thriving underground music and art scene, and it’s very LGBT-friendly compared to many places in China. Don’t miss weekend trips to nearby mountains or parks – Qingcheng Mountain and Emei Mountain are nearby, and you can visit the Giant Buddha in Leshan. Fun fact: locals might offer you odd delicacies (like spicy rabbit head) – it’s a local specialty, but you can politely decline if it’s too adventurous for you (there’s not much meat on it anyway for the price)
reddit.com
. Overall, if you value a slower pace and rich culture, you’ll love Chengdu. Guangzhou (广州): A southern metropolis and one of China’s largest cities, part of the Pearl River Delta mega-city region. It’s the birthplace of Cantonese cuisine, so food is a highlight here (think dim sum, roast pork, and more, generally less spicy and with an emphasis on fresh ingredients). Pros: Guangzhou is a bit cheaper than its neighbor Shenzhen and far cheaper than Shanghai for living costs. The local culture is very entrepreneurial – people are friendly but always hustling. There’s a long history of international trade, so you’ll see a diverse expat mix (large African and Middle Eastern communities, for example). If you work in business or trading, you’ll likely pass through Guangzhou (the Canton Fair happens twice a year, bringing traders from all over the world). For teachers, there are many international and bilingual schools. English is not widely spoken on the streets, but businesses that deal with foreigners (markets, some restaurants) often can manage basic English. Cons: The weather is HOT and humid most of the year. Summers are brutal (expect 35°C with near 100% humidity). There’s basically no winter – just a cooler, drier season around Dec–Feb. Some people find the climate challenging, but on the bright side, you won’t need heavy winter gear. Air quality is usually decent, but can spike during industrial activity. Guangzhou is not as flashy as Shanghai or Shenzhen – it’s more traditional in some ways. Nightlife exists (there are expat bars in areas like Zhujiang New Town or around the upscale TaiKoo Hui mall), but it’s more low-key. Public transport is excellent (the metro is extensive and cheap). One tip: Guangzhou is well-connected by high-speed rail – you can zip to Hong Kong or Shenzhen in about an hour, which is great for weekend trips or visa runs if needed. Culturally, try to pick up a few Cantonese phrases; locals will be tickled if you can say “mm goi” (thank you) in Cantonese. But Mandarin will work with younger people or outside local markets (everyone learns Mandarin in school). Guangzhou has lovely parks and a slower pace than, say, Shenzhen – take evening strolls on the Pearl River promenade or join locals doing tai chi in Yuexiu Park to really soak in the life. Shenzhen (深圳): A gleaming modern city that went from a fishing village to a tech megacity in 40 years. It’s directly across the border from Hong Kong and has a very young population (average age is early 30s). Pros: Everything is new – infrastructure, malls, parks. It feels very “optimized” and convenient. If you’re into technology, this is the place: Tencent is headquartered here, and there’s a huge startup scene. Cashless payments and high-tech solutions are integrated into daily life deeply. Expats in Shenzhen are often in tech, finance, or education. The city is relatively green and clean with nice beaches a short distance away (Dameisha, Xiaomeisha beaches, etc.). Because it’s built for modern living, you have large apartments (compared to cramped Hong Kong) and lots of shopping and entertainment options. Shekou (in Nanshan District) is a hotspot for expats – it has international schools, the Seaworld plaza with Western restaurants, and a sizeable foreign community due to many shipping and oil companies historically basing there. Cons: Culturally, Shenzhen is still finding its identity. Since almost everyone is a transplant (from other parts of China or abroad), it doesn’t have the same historical vibe or distinct local culture that older cities do. Some expats find it a bit sterile for this reason. Nightlife exists (mostly in Futian and Nanshan districts), but can be a bit scattered unless you know the scene. The cost of living, while lower than Shanghai, is not cheap – housing in desirable districts can be pricey. And while Hong Kong is next door, it currently requires paperwork (ensure you have a multi-entry visa or a separate visa for HK if needed) – but it’s a huge perk for flights or a weekend getaway to a more international city. One challenge: while Mandarin is the official language, locals originally speak Cantonese – however, due to the migrant nature of the city, Mandarin is common. English is not as widely spoken as in Shanghai/Beijing, so you still should learn basic Mandarin. Lastly, summers are very hot and typhoon-prone (keep an eye on weather alerts for big storms). Shenzhen is a great choice if you like modern city life, a touch of international flair (without being as westernized as Shanghai), and lots of innovation. Hangzhou (杭州): A beautiful city famous for West Lake, green hills, and its emerging tech scene (Alibaba’s HQ is here). It’s often described as a city where you can experience both ancient China and cutting-edge modernity. Pros: Scenic beauty – West Lake is gorgeous and surrounded by temples, gardens, and cafes. The city has worked to preserve green spaces, so it’s quite pleasant if you like the outdoors (great biking paths, hiking in tea plantations, etc.). Hangzhou people speak Mandarin (with a local accent) and the city, being a tourist draw, has some English signage and support in touristy areas. Cost of living is moderate: not as cheap as smaller cities, but cheaper than Beijing/Shanghai. You can afford a nicer/larger apartment here for what a basic one might cost in Shanghai. There is a small but tight-knit expat community, including a lot of tech expats and English teachers. You’ll likely run into the same people at the few expat bars or events, which gives a sense of community. Cons: The expat scene and Western amenities are more limited – you might not find certain international cuisines or products as easily (though Alibaba’s hometown advantage means good e-commerce options). Socially, you might need to make more effort to meet people (fewer big events than in Shanghai). However, being just an hour away from Shanghai by high-speed train means you can always hop over for a weekend if you crave big-city excitement. Hangzhou’s weather is similar to Shanghai – hot, humid summers and a cold, damp winter (it might even snow a bit). One thing to note: Hangzhou’s public transport is improving (the metro is expanding), but it’s not as extensive as older major cities yet, so you might rely on buses or Didi more, depending on where you live. If you’re into tech, Hangzhou hosts a lot of conferences and has a vibrant startup scene thanks to Alibaba’s ecosystem. Try to learn about Chinese tea culture here – Hangzhou’s Longjing (Dragon Well) tea is famous, and going to a tea village for a tasting is a quintessential local experience. Suzhou (苏州): Often paired with Hangzhou in the proverb “Above there is heaven, below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou,” this city is renowned for its classical gardens and canals. Suzhou is in Jiangsu province, very close to Shanghai (25 min by bullet train). Pros: Suzhou has a mix of old and new. The old town with canals, cobbled streets, and UNESCO heritage gardens is beautiful and gives a more traditional Chinese feel. The Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), on the other hand, is a modern development zone with wide roads, malls, international schools, and lots of expat housing – many foreign companies have offices or factories here. As a result, there is a concentrated expat community in SIP (and the adjoining Suzhou New District on the west side). Living in SIP can feel a bit like living in a suburb – convenient and clean but a little insulated. The cost of living is quite reasonable; you get more space for your money than in Shanghai. It’s a great place for families – cleaner air, less traffic, and plenty of international schooling options. Cons: If you’re a young single expat looking for a buzzing nightlife, Suzhou itself might feel a bit quiet. There are a handful of expat pubs and restaurants (and more opening as the community grows), but many people head to Shanghai on weekends for more excitement. Culturally, the local dialect (Suzhouhua, a Wu dialect) is very different from Mandarin – older locals might not speak Mandarin fluently, but anyone under 40 will. Suzhou has four distinct seasons; the summers can be very hot (and it’s one of the “oven” cities like Chongqing/Wuhan), and winters are chilly and damp (no central heating here either). The city infrastructure is modernizing – there’s a metro now, and SIP is very easy to navigate. If you want a balance of traditional culture with modern comforts, and a slower pace than Shanghai, Suzhou is excellent. Pro tip: visit the classical gardens in the off-peak times (early morning weekdays) to enjoy them without the tourist crowds, and take time to explore the water towns around Suzhou (like Zhouzhuang or Tongli) for a step back in time.
Final Tips
Stay Flexible and Positive: The first few months in China can be a rollercoaster. You’ll likely experience an initial honeymoon period followed by culture shock. That’s normal. When things get overwhelming (e.g. struggling to communicate at the bank, or missing your favorite food from home), take a deep breath and remind yourself why you came – for adventure, new experiences, personal growth. Patience and a sense of humor are your best friends. Don’t be afraid to ask for help; most locals will try their best to assist if you’re polite (or find a younger person – they might know some English). Every expat has bad China days; the key is to not let them outweigh the good days.
Health and Well-being: If you have any medical conditions, bring a doctor’s note and medication (and maybe get it translated to Chinese). Big cities have international hospitals where doctors speak English, but they are pricey. For minor ailments, Chinese pharmacies can be convenient – staff might not speak English, but showing a translation or even acting out symptoms can work (many meds have English on the box too). Be proactive about things like air quality – on polluted days (which happen mostly in north China and winter months), use an air purifier at home and consider a mask outdoors. Exercise is important for mental health too: join a gym, go for runs in parks (morning and evening you’ll see many locals dancing or doing tai chi – feel free to join!). Also, expect your stomach to need an adjustment period – the food, water (always drink filtered or boiled water), and even air might cause some minor issues at first. Carry some basic meds (Imodium, Pepto, etc.) just in case. And yes, the habit of drinking warm water isn’t a bad one – you might find it soothes your throat and digestion, as locals claim. Give it a try!
Respect the Culture: Little gestures go a long way. Learn how to say “thank you” (谢謝 xièxiè) and use it often. When you receive or give something (like business cards, or a gift), use two hands – it’s seen as more respectful

. If you’re invited to someone’s home, bring a small gift (fruit, chocolates). When eating with Chinese friends, you might hear a polite fight over who pays the bill – it’s common to offer to pay as a sign of courtesy (and the host will usually insist on paying in the end). Take your shoes off when entering a local’s home if you see others doing so. Avoid pointing with your finger (use an open hand gesture instead). These are small things, and Chinese people won’t expect foreigners to know all customs, but making an effort shows your respect.
Build a Routine: In the midst of all the newness, establishing a routine can keep you grounded. Whether it’s a weekly call home to family, a Friday night dinner at your favorite local noodle shop, or a Saturday basketball game with colleagues, find rhythms that give structure to your week. It will help combat homesickness and give you things to look forward to. Also, continue any hobbies or self-care practices you did back home – if you play guitar, bring it and keep playing; if you jog, find a route and stick to it. These familiar activities provide a sense of normalcy.
Explore China: Don’t confine your experience to just one city. China is huge and diverse. Each region has its own culture, dialect, and cuisine. Take advantage of being here to travel on holidays. As a teacher, you’ll likely have decent vacation time – use it! Visit the historic sites in Xi’an, the rice terraces in Guangxi, the beaches in Hainan, the mountains of Yunnan, or the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Travel domestically is quite affordable: high-speed trains are fantastic and usually cheaper than flying, and overnight sleeper trains or buses are an adventure worth trying at least once. You’ll come back to your city with a deeper appreciation of how varied China is, and it’ll make you a more resourceful traveler. (Pro tip: avoid traveling during major holidays like Chinese New Year or National Day “Golden Week” – millions hit the road then, leading to sold-out tickets and crowded spots.)
Save Where You Can: Your goal might be to save money while in China (many foreign teachers do manage to save a good chunk of their salary). An easy way to save is by living more like a local: cook Chinese dishes at home (vegetables, rice, noodles from local markets are very cheap), and socialize the local way (inexpensive BBQ skewers and beer at a street stall with friends, for example, instead of pricey clubs). Transportation is another area – buses and subways cost next to nothing, whereas taking taxis or ride-shares everywhere will add up (and frankly, in big cities the metro is often faster). That said, do treat yourself occasionally – whether it’s a trip to that imported grocery store for some cheese, or a weekend in a fancy hotel, a little comfort purchase now and then can keep you happy and motivated. It’s all about balance.
Connect with Other Expats: Sometimes you just need to vent or share a funny observation (“My students just gave me the cutest handmade card!” or “I can’t figure out what the repairman said about my AC…”). Having expat friends who understand your perspective is important. They can provide moral support and practical tips. In many cities, there are expat meetups (check Facebook or WeChat for “Expats in ___” groups). There are also interest-based groups (photography clubs, church groups, sports teams) that are largely foreigner or mixed foreigner/local. For example, if you like soccer, many cities have expat amateur teams you can join. These social outlets give you a sense of community. Just remember to also keep bridging out into the local community – a mix of expat and local friends will give you the best of both worlds.
Embrace the Experience: Living in China will likely be one of the most memorable chapters of your life. There will be highs (like the thrill of successfully bargaining in Chinese, or the first time you hold a basic conversation with a local) and lows (bureaucracy can be frustrating, you’ll miss family, etc.), but overall it’s a growth experience. Take photos, keep a journal or blog of your experiences – not only is it therapeutic, you’ll love looking back on it. Say yes to opportunities that come your way, whether it’s learning a new skill like calligraphy, trying on a traditional outfit for a festival, or visiting a colleague’s hometown for a local holiday. You’ll leave China with stories to last a lifetime. And if at times you feel like you’re not “getting it” or you made a cultural faux pas, don’t be too hard on yourself – even long-time expats are still learning. The Chinese have a saying, “入乡随俗” (rù xiāng suí sú) – “When you enter a village, follow its customs.” Do your best to adapt and appreciate, and you’ll find China embracing you back.
Conclusion: By focusing on integrating digitally (with apps and cashless payments), culturally (through language and local friendships), and practically (with savvy tips on housing, banking, and daily life), you’ll set yourself up for a rewarding stay in China. Living in China as a foreigner can be challenging, but it’s also incredibly rewarding – you’ll gain new perspectives, lifelong friends, and perhaps a second home. Enjoy the journey and best of luck in your adventure!
