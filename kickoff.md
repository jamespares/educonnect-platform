I want to create a super simple and clean website for a recruitment agency.

The agency helps teachers from the UK/US get good teaching jobs in China. The jobs are all 25K+ RMB per month including paid holidays and medical insurance. 

The website will be connected to a database which stores all the details of the teachers that sign up. I will then use those details to pitch these teachers to Chinese recruiters and organise interviews. If they get hired, I will get paid. 

The website should have a header, a hero section, some info and then a footer. It will also need a sign up page where teachers can enter their details (name, education, years of experience, place of experience, and short intro-video, email, phone phumber). This info will need to be stored in the database and visualised in the admin account in a dynamic table so I can quickly check who is on our books and update their status (searching for job, employed, inactive etc.)

It will the educonnect logo in the top left. And place holder for some images I will add later.
